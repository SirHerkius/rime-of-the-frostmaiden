By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the @spell[greater restoration] spell.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a @creature[lich]'s life drain attack.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a @spell[wish] spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li></ul><p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p><p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take [[/r 1d10]] necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for [[/r 2d4]] days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a [[/r 1d100]] (33 percent) chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":0,"width":null,"units":"self","type":"self"},"range":{"value":0,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"heal","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["1d10","necrotic"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":9,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"folder":"9LT5TDetlpCwyiPp","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GA0NQsN0sdRueCww":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"spells.html","source":"PHB","hash":"wish_phb","propDroppable":"spell"}}}

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p>\n<p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>\n<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"},"proficient":true,"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"range":{"value":5,"long":0,"units":"ft"}},"effects":[],"folder":"9LT5TDetlpCwyiPp","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GA0NQsN0sdRueCww":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"items.html","source":"PHB","hash":"spellbook_phb","propDroppable":"item"}}}

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.
