When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p><p>As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p><p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it.

This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: @spell[Bigby's hand] (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), @spell[cone of cold] (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as @spell[flesh to stone] except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), @spell[ice storm] (2 charges), @spell[Otiluke's freezing sphere] (3 charges), @spell[sleet storm] (1 charge), @spell[spike growth] (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or @spell[wall of ice] (2 charges).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: @condition[charmed], @condition[exhaustion], @condition[frightened], @condition[paralyzed], @condition[petrified], and @condition[poisoned]. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 ([[/r 1d10]]) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1237\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Other Properties.</span></span> <p>The <i>Ring of Winter</i> is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break.

The <i>Wyrmskull Throne</i> was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet—the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.</p><p>After the fall of Shanatar, the <i>Wyrmskull Throne</i> fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the @creature[storm giant] Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the <i>Wyrmskull Throne</i>, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.</p><p>Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is @condition[paralyzed] and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains @condition[paralyzed] until it is separated from the throne.</p><p>Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic—the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1433\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Properties of the Throne.</span></span> <p>The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

This property doesn't expend any charges.</p><p>Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.</p><p>As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast @spell[lightning bolt] (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 ([[/r 14d6]]) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.</p><p>As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the @spell[globe of invulnerability] spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.</p><p>As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an @creature[ancient blue dragon] that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an @creature[ancient blue dragon||ancient blue dragon's] bite and claw attacks.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1434\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Destroying the Throne.</span></span> <p>The <i>Wyrmskull Throne</i> can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it.

The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.</p><p>A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates [[/r 1d100]] hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as @spell[identify] and @spell[divination] can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</p><p>A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p>\n<p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>\n<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"range":{"value":5,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"cd2uAhzWqiaHc8ig":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"page":"items.html","source":"PHB","hash":"spellbook_phb","propDroppable":"item"}}}

While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a [[/r 1d100]] (25 percent) chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement.

During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.</li></ul><p>While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1138\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Ghost in the Machine.</span></span> <p>Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be @condition[charmed] for 24 hours.

The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 ([[/r 25d6]]) force damage, 87 ([[/r 25d6]]) lightning damage, and 87 ([[/r 25d6]]) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.</p><p>This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, [[/r 2d6]] days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1140\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Destroying the Servant.</span></span> <p>The servant can be destroyed in two ways.

In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</p><p>A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.</p><p>A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.</p><p>A moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.</p><p>A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically [[/r 1d6 + 1]]). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property.

In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability.

Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall @condition[unconscious] for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being @condition[charmed]. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An @condition[unconscious] creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it.

Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the <i>Crook of Rao</i> was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the <i>Crook of Rao</i> -potentially for the final time.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"882\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Random Properties.</span></span> <p>The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">2 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial] properties</li><li class=\"rd__li \">1 @table[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial] property</li><li class=\"rd__li \">1 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental] property</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"883\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\">Spells.</span></span> <p>The crook has 6 charges.

Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the <i>Crook of Rao</i>, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent @spell[gate] spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the <i>Crook of Rao</i>. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate.

The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a @item[devastation orb of air|PotA]. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.</p><p>A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates [[/r 1d100]] hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as @spell[identify] and @spell[divination] can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</p><p>A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb's opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a @item[devastation orb of air|PotA] and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes [[/r 1d6]] rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.</p><p>Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius.

If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after [[/r 2d10]] hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect: at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood's path is swept away.
