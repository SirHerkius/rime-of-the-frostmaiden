To use this ability, you must have @item[thieves' tools|PHB] or @item[artisan's tools|PHB] in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li></ul><p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</p><p>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p></div><div data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link \"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything\">TCE</span> p9</span></span> <p>You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects.

You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically @item[thieves' tools|phb] or some kind of @item[artisan's tools|phb|artisan's tool]—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an 'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB,4\">chapter 5</a>, \"Equipment,\" in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> for descriptions of these tools.</p><p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"5\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Magic of Artifice</span></span><p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast @spell[cure wounds] using @item[alchemist's supplies|PHB], you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @item[tinker's tools|PHB], you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast @spell[poison spray], you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace @spell[cure wounds] with @spell[heat metal], you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"6\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</span></span> <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.

The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents.",{"type":"entries","name":"Arcane Science","entries":["In the world of Eberron, arcane magic has been harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society. Artificers reflect this development. Their knowledge of magical devices, and their ability to infuse mundane items with magic, allows Eberron's most miraculous projects to continue.","During the Last War, artificers were marshaled on a massive scale. Many lives were saved because of the inventions of brave artificers, but countless lives were also lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by their creations."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Seekers of New Lore","entries":["Nothing excites an artificer quite like uncovering a new metal or discovering a source of elemental energy. In artificer circles, new inventions and strange discoveries create the most excitement. Artificers who wish to make their mark must innovate, creating something fresh, rather than iterating on familiar designs.","This drive for novelty pushes artificers to become adventurers. Eberron's main travel routes and populated regions have long since been explored. Thus, artificers seek the frontiers of civilization in hopes of making the next great discovery in arcane research."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Creating an Artificer","entries":["When creating an artificer, think about your character's relationship with the artisan who taught them their craft.

In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the World of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational. In the City of Sigil, artificers share discoveries from throughout the cosmos, and one in particular—the gnome inventor Vi—has run a multiverse-spanning business from there since leaving the world of her birth, Eberron. In the world-city Ravnica, the Izzet League trains numerous artificers, the destructiveness of whom is unparalleled in other worlds—except, perhaps, by the tinker gnomes of Krynn."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Quick Build","entries":["You can make an artificer quickly by following these suggestions.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall @condition[unconscious], drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p><p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked @condition[unconscious].</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as @spell[call lightning], that you've already cast.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as <span class=\"help help--hover\" data-plut-hover=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload=\"true\" data-plut-hover-preload-id=\"7\">darkvision</span>, unless your new form also has that sense.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li></ul></div><div data-source=\"UAClassFeatureVariants\" class=\"rd__b spicy-sauce rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"155\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wild Companion</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link \"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants\">UACFV</span> p4</span></span> <p><i>2nd-level druid feature (enhances Wild Shape)</i></p><p>You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the @spell[find familiar] spell, without material components.</p><p>When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.</p></div><div data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"156\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wild Companion</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link \"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything\">TCE</span> p35</span></span> <p><i>2nd-level druid @variantrule[optional class features|tce|optional feature]</i></p><p>You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the @spell[find familiar] spell, without material components.</p><p>When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.</p></div><div data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"157\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Druid Circle</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link \"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Player’s Handbook\">PHB</span> p64</span></span> <p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles.

Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.","Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Preserve the Balance","entries":["For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.","Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.","Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature.

Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.","Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring?

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.","Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.","Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants."]},{"type":"inset","name":"Druids and the Gods","entries":["Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.","In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.","The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations."]}],"source":"PHB","page":64},{"type":"section","entries":[{"type":"quote","entries":["Even in death, each creature plays its part in maintaining the Great Balance.

Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.","Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild.

No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained.

The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.","The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells.

Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.","Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Creating a Bard","entries":["Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not.

But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Creating a Ranger","entries":["As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.","What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers?

It is a thankless job, since their efforts are rarely understood and almost never rewarded. Yet rangers persist in their duties, never doubting that their work makes the world a safer place.","A relationship with civilization informs every ranger's personality and history. Some rangers see themselves as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on civilization's frontier, answering to no sovereign power. Others are survivalists who eschew civilization altogether. They vanquish monsters to keep themselves safe while they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of the world.

Indeed, to those who have seen them operate and been the beneficiaries of their prowess, it scarcely matters why rangers do what they do. That said, no two rangers are likely to express their opinions on any matter in the same way.","If you haven't yet thought about the details of your character's worldview, consider putting a finer point on things by summarizing that viewpoint in a short statement (such as the entries on the following table).

Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p><p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p><p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master's Guide.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"303\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ability Score Improvement</span> <span class=\"rd__title-link \"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Player’s Handbook\">PHB</span> p82</span></span> <p>When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.","Adventuring paladins take their work seriously.

Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge?

Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.","As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment.
